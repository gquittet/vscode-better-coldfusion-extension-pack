# Better ColdFusion Extension Pack

VSCode has no support for ColdFusion. Working at Qualifio,  
we use a lot of ColdFusion, so I have to be productive.  
So, I made this extension pack that add Python powers to VSCode.

## List of extensions built-in

- KamasamaK.vscode-cflint
- KamasamaK.vscode-cfml

**Enjoy!**
